            <li>
              Our textbooks are based on Islamic World View and epistemology.
              However, it doesn&#39;t mean that it lacks modern standards in any respect.
            </li>
            <li>
              Our textbooks are subject-centric, which means we focus the subject matter in a way that the
              very content of the subject is delivered to the child being vibrant for his/her intellect.
            </li>
            <li>
              Our textbooks are developed in local perspective.
              The context and content of the lessons are very relevant to our society.

              Our textbooks are concept oriented. Hence, the development of cognitive skills has
              always been the point of emphasis.

            <li>
              Assessments and exercises are designed to meet SLOs, beyond a mere test of child&#39;s memorization skill.

            <li>
              Students read our textbooks with zeal and interest, to achieve this,
              we have tried very hard to ensure that our textbooks are aesthetically well-developed and
              interesting in terms of content. We have used illustrations and
              imported paper to let the child connect with the book.

              <h3>Urdu</h3>
              <p>
                The mastery of own language is essential because it serves as a means of expression and a
                tool for gratifying one&#39;s aesthetic aspirations. In our country, the reliance on the English
                language eroded the prestige of Urdu to the verge of extinction for decades. Urdu is confined
                to the context of a subject only. Its content and teaching are given scant consideration which
                has resulted in individuals having little or no command over the language.
              </p>
              <p>
                Urdu curriculum and textbooks always seems to be a combination of sociology and ethics instead
                of Urdu literature. In typical textbooks, the children are given arid lessons to read, which are
                difficult for a young child to develop an interest. That is why these books are unable to develop
                imagination, aesthetics and hence incapable of mastering the Urdu language.
              </p>
              <p>Ehya e Urdu:</p>
              <p>
                At Ehya Education Services, we have made a concerted effort to fill these voids in our Urdu
                books in the following ways:
              </p>
              <ul className="customList customListDisc mt-1">
                <li>The textbooks are developed with the aim to instill love of Urdu language in the heart of student.</li>
                <li>The exercises are not there to test the memory of the students but they are designed in a way to ignite creative skills of the child and increase the competency of Urdu language.</li>
                <li>The design of the books are appealing. Illustrations and color schemes are eye-catching.</li>
                <li>The lessons are chosen to increase the competency and interest of Urdu language.</li>
                <li>To keep the interest of children the lessons are written in story mode.</li>
                <li>We have tried our best that the lessons develop adoration to the Urdu literature, aesthetics and creativity in a child.</li>

              <h3>Science</h3>
              <p>
                Science, when taught as a subject, must inculcate in a student some abilities that serves
                as the purpose of teaching this subject. Science is about observation of surrounding,
                studying the phenomena related to physical world, understanding fundamental laws governing
                changes within ourselves and the world outside. Regrettably, Science when taught in our education
                system fails to develop any basic ability presumed to be associated with the teaching of science.
                Rather this subject overburdens our students with a noticeable amount of material in the form of
                &#39;definitions&#39; that demands to be memorized and reproduced upon the examination paper on the exam day.
                It has nothing to do with the development of understanding fundamental laws and phenomena related
                to observable world. Most of the students studying science in our country cannot explain the
                phenomenon of rain- a repetitive occurrence, the concepts of solid, liquid, gas, conductor,
                non-conductor, current, atom, flow of electrons, electromagnetic flux etc. are not alien to them
                in terms of definitions, but these ideas are totally alien and irrelevant to them as concepts
                crucial to understand and explain our surroundings and even ourselves.
              </p>
              <p>
                Ehya Education Services has taken all of these elements into account when writing textbooks of
                Science. We have written these textbooks in interrogative style instead of an article style.
                This will not only instill in the child a desire to learn new things but will also instill in
                him the habit of observation. These textbooks of Science not only presents the necessary
                information and concepts but also sheds light on their application in daily life. This connection
                with everyday life will not only arouse the students&#39; natural curiosity but also unleash the
                scientist in them.
              </p>
              <p>
                We believe that the best way to teach science is to perform it rather than rote it.
                To that end, we&#39;ve included scientific inquires in our textbooks to help improve children&#39;s
                analytical skills. We have added activities and experiments throughout the textbooks to help
                students learn to create evidence and draw conclusions. It was considered to keep activities
                simple and easy. One of the notable feature of our textbooks is its assessments. We have added
                both formative assessments, to keep students engaged during class, and summative assessments
                at the end of chapters to assess students&#39; cognitive skills.
              </p>
              <p>
                Furthermore, the language of the book is kept simple and child-friendly so that the children
                could read without any help. Design elements have been worked on to make the book more
                attractive, and images have been added to make the text more comprehensible.

              <h3>Social Studies</h3>
              <p>
                Human beings are a complex creation of Allah. Yet they are the most efficient creation,
                who resides in complex and diverse social settings. These social settings are affected by
                multiple factors, ethnical diversity, different environmental conditions, different cultures
                and cultural backgrounds and a variety of geographical regions etc. To understand human society
                and drive it towards betterment, Social Studies is an important subject taught at school level
                around the globe. The main components of this subject are geography and history
                (along with politics, economics, sociology, anthropology etc.) of a certain region to comprehend
                the multi-perspective and diverse nature of the particular region. This subject is supposed to:
              </p>
              <ul className="customList customListDisc mt-1 mb-3">
                <li>Develop capacities supportive to the coexisting environment of a society by understanding diversity in geographical and historical backgrounds.</li>
                <li>Develop an understanding of the history and how it affects our present and future.</li>
                <li>Develop a relationship of human society and environment and their mutual effect.</li>
                <li>Develop aptitude of critical thinking and logical decision making by understanding the local context.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                By comprehending above goals a student would be able to play an effective role as a citizen.
                His/her decision making power, critical thinking and communication skill should escalate.
                Unfortunately, Social Studies has become one of the biggest source of boredom for our students
                in school life. Because social studies is taught as something irrelevant to the student&#39;s
                practical life and it is all about difficult names of places and events of the past that a
                student feels he/she has nothing to do with.
              </p>
              <p>
                Ehya Education Services has made every possible effort to resolve all these concerns and has
                attempted to create books that are both motivating and interactive. These books are intended
                to help pupils improve their cognitive skills and develop logical thinking. The chapters are
                organized in such a way that students will clearly grasp and connect the topics to their true
                meaning and apply these in their everyday life. These books will enhance their concept building
                and creative skills.
              </p>
              <p>
                We&#39;ve included some highly fascinating and thought-provoking tasks that will motivate students
                to use their imagination and ingenuity to solve them. Our textbooks will introduce students to a
                new universe in which they may view a range of things. The activities are extremely engaging and
                improve students&#39; logical thinking and analytical reasoning by allowing them to relate the
                problem to its issue and then design solutions to the challenges.
              </p>
              <p>
                The information is added according to the kids&#39; age groups. The text volumes contain engaging
                illustrations that will keep students involved in the book and prevent them from losing interest.
                Students will be able to investigate historical civilizations and get a comprehensive
                understanding of the people who lived in the past, including their lifestyles, economic, social,
                and political systems. All of the activities include interactive questions that encourage
                inquiry-based and collaborative learning. All examples, activities and illustrations have local
                perspective to produce indigenous intelligentsia.

              <h3>Islamic Studies</h3>
              <p>
                Islamic Studies not only holds a critical importance for the survival of our national identity,
                but it is also a religious duty. Though the curriculum of Islamic Studies and textbooks provide a
                plethora of information about Islam, no effort is made to effectively teach the religion and
                inspire students to practice it. These are designed to help students memorize material and pass exams.
              </p>
              <p>
                In contrast, a good Islamic curriculum and textbook should encompass much more. At the very least,
                this book should be much more than a religious handbook; it should provide answers to the
                queries and problems that children may have about Islam and its role in the modern world.
              </p>
              <p>
                Ehya Education Services, in its textbooks of Islamic Studies, aims to address these issues
                and make Islamic Studies viable for students. The following areas have been given precise
                focus while developing the books.
              </p>
              <ul className="customList customListDisc mt-1">
                <li>We use examples from everyday life to elucidate concepts in order to persuade students to practice Islam. For this, the students&#39; intellectual degree and class level have been taken into account in such a way that the beliefs and concepts are gradually articulated.</li>
                <li>Typically, Islamic Studies lessons, from inception to delivery, focus on conveying information. Apart from the traditional manner, we have retained the style of Islamic Studies with stories, engaging lessons and design elements rather than merely thematic lessons in our books. Furthermore, we have tried to ensure that the student understands the topic and its repercussions.</li>
                <li>Another element of our books that distinguishes it from others is Exercises. Exercise questions in textbooks are typically used to evaluate memorization. We&#39;ve tried to make sure that students grasp the learning outcomes and fundamental concepts through practice and activities. A permanent component has also been incorporated to help students strengthen their relationship with the Quran.</li>
