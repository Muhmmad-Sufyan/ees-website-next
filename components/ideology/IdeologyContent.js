          <p className="text-justify">
            Ehya believes that education should be based upon indigenous thoughts and values.
            The points at which Akbar and Iqbal differed with Sir Syed are very valuable. Moreover,
            the critique of Iqbal on the West are an integral part of Ehya&#39;s ideology and working.
            Key components of the framework that would form the foundation the education system based
            on Ehya&#39;s core values include the following.

                  To create a cohesive society, a thorough knowledge of its culture, customs,
                  and festivals is key factor. A &ldquo;model&rdquo; individual for Ehya is someone who is an active
                  member of the Muslim Ummah and a vibrant part of the local community.

                <h4>Assessment</h4>
                <p>
                  Individuals cannot be expected to become true seekers of knowledge if an assessment system fails to
                  train the mind to think beyond its memory level. The assessment system should be teacher-centered,
                  and student&#39;s creativity should not be suppressed for the sake of standardized assessments.
                  Students should be provided with avenues to discover new horizons so that they can understand
                  their value and mission on Earth. If one aspect of their personality is weak, then some other vital
                  aspect of their personality should be nurtured.

                <h4>STEM Based Education vs. Social Sciences</h4>
                <p>
                  Importance of science and STEM based education in the present times
                  cannot be negated, but humanities and social sciences should also be given
                  due importance. Learning of science begins with observations, general
                  understanding of the environment and practical applications before
                  bombarding pupils with technical jargon. Students must be trained to achieve
                  a know-how of their surroundings by digging deeper into the realities that
                  surround them and manifest the sublime authority and power of Almighty Allah.
                  Moreover, the focus of education must shift from being economic centric to person centric.
                  STEM based education is not the rationale approach for our society.
                  It also means to inculcate developmental prospects for an individual in the domain of education.

                <h4>Developing Creativity and Aesthetics</h4>
                <p>
                  New ways should be devised to refine creativity and aesthetics in an individual.
                  Teaching of good literature is important in this regard, however the real task is to
                  find appropriate literature for children belonging to different age groups.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The human mind cannot reach its maturity without developing an
                  appreciation of beauty in words and worlds. Inculcation of local and
                  Muslim literature, calligraphy, architecture and other forms of aesthetics
                  in the education process is therefore necessary to achieve this goal.
                  Studying in outdoor milieus can encourage children to think-out-of-box as well as develop
                  vital life skills.

                <p>
                  Modernity aspires to define the past and determine the future in its own paradigm.
                  In order to break the shackles of modernity, one must be acquainted and inspired by
                  prominent personalities in the course of history, religious or academic texts or writings
                  and cultural values that lie beyond the horizon of time. Moreover, connecting modern
                  history with the salient features of Islamic history are an essential requisite of our curriculum.
                  The role of Muslims in history as well as in the present times is highlighted in our curriculum.

                <h4>Academic Excellence</h4>
                <p>
                  In our education system a student is not treated as a mature individual till the age
                  of 20 and even more. In Pakistan, unfortunately, even a 25 years old educated individual
                  lacks the ability to critically analyze academic text or writings. Students should be
                  coached so that they are intellectually mature by the age of 18 and are able to conduct
                  critical analysis. By this age, they must have explored themselves and should be clear about
                  their future endeavors.

                <h4>Islamic Ideology</h4>
                <p>
                  The ideal curriculum in an Islamic society would lead learners to grasp the actual meaning
                  of their Islamic identity, allowing them to be religious as well as patriotic so that they
                  may understand their true purpose on Earth. It must include elements that are necessary to
                  formulate worldly perspectives within the Islamic paradigm, so that they can find answers to
                  the questions that arise due to the dichotomy of knowledge to which they are exposed.

                <p>
                  The contemporary mass education system is highly influenced by
                  nationalism being imposed through the power exercised by the states and is
                  mainly the servant of capital and power. It is imperative to have an
                  individual-centric approach that can produce children who are capable of
                  discovering their true talents and potentials. A well-groomed person can
                  excel in his/her field of interest and possesses the ability to polish his/her innate capabilities.
                  Collective goals are also important but they need to be added in due proportion in the curriculum.

                <h4>Language Skills</h4>
                <p>
                  Language is not just the art of communicating or expressing ideas and opinions but it is also
                  a barometer for determining the depth of a person. So, the objective of language learning
                  should not be limited to functional aspects only. A literate person must be able to understand
                  and interact beyond textual information and must understand the reality and meaningfulness
                  behind those words. Appreciation of a text must be associated with both the affective part
                  of human mind as well as its cognitive part.
                </p>
