            The Ideology of <span>EHYA</span>
          </h2>
          <p>
            Ehya believes that education should be based upon indigenous
            thoughts and values. The points at which Akbar and Iqbal differed
            with Sir Syed are very valuable. Moreover, the critique of Iqbal
            on the West are an integral part of Ehya&#39;s ideology and working.
            Key components of the framework that would form the foundation the
            education system based on Ehya&#39;s core values include the
            following.

                <h4>Relevance</h4>
                <p>
                  To create a cohesive society, a thorough knowledge of its
                  culture, customs, and festivals is key factor. A
                  &ldquo;model&rdquo; individual for Ehya is someone who is an
                  active member of the Muslim Ummah and a vibrant part of the
                  local community.

                <h4>Assessment</h4>
                <p>
                  Individuals cannot be expected to become true seekers of
                  knowledge if an assessment system fails to train the mind to
                  think beyond its memory level. The assessment system should
                  be teacher-centered, and student&#39;s creativity should not be
                  suppressed for the sake of standardized assessments. Students
                  should be provided with avenues to discover new horizons so
                  that they can understand their value and mission on Earth. If
                  one aspect of their personality is weak, then some other
                  vital aspect of their personality should be nurtured.

                <h4>STEM Based Education vs. Social Sciences</h4>
                <p>
                  Importance of science and STEM based education in the present
                  times cannot be negated, but humanities and social sciences
                  should also be given due importance. Learning of science
                  begins with observations, general understanding of the
                  environment and practical applications before bombarding
                  pupils with technical jargon. Students must be trained to
                  achieve a know-how of their surroundings by digging deeper
                  into the realities that surround them and manifest the
                  sublime authority and power of Almighty Allah. Moreover, the
                  focus of education must shift from being economic centric to
                  person centric. STEM based education is not the rationale
                  approach for our society. It also means to inculcate
                  developmental prospects for an individual in the domain of
                  education.

                <h4>Developing Creativity and Aesthetics</h4>
                <p>
                  New ways should be devised to refine creativity and
                  aesthetics in an individual. Teaching of good literature is
                  important in this regard, however the real task is to find
                  appropriate literature for children belonging to different
                  age groups. The human mind cannot reach its maturity without
                  developing an appreciation of beauty in words and worlds.
                  Inculcation of local and Muslim literature, calligraphy,
                  architecture and other forms of aesthetics in the education
                  process is therefore necessary to achieve this goal. Studying
                  in outdoor milieus can encourage children to
                  think-out-of-box as well as develop vital life skills.

                <h4>Tradition Vs Modernity</h4>
                <p>
                  Modernity aspires to define the past and determine the future
                  in its own paradigm. In order to break the shackles of
                  modernity, one must be acquainted and inspired by prominent
                  personalities in the course of history, religious or academic
                  texts or writings and cultural values that lie beyond the
                  horizon of time. Moreover, connecting modern history with the
                  salient features of Islamic history are an essential
                  requisite of our curriculum. The role of Muslims in history
                  as well as in the present times is highlighted in our
                  curriculum.

                <h4>Academic Excellence</h4>
                <p>
                  In our education system a student is not treated as a mature
                  individual till the age of 20 and even more. In Pakistan,
                  unfortunately, even a 25 years old educated individual lacks
                  the ability to critically analyze academic text or writings.
                  Students should be coached so that they are intellectually
                  mature by the age of 18 and are able to conduct critical
                  analysis. By this age, they must have explored themselves and
                  should be clear about their future endeavors.

                <h4>Islamic Ideology</h4>
                <p>
                  The ideal curriculum in an Islamic society would lead
                  learners to grasp the actual meaning of their Islamic
                  identity, allowing them to be religious as well as patriotic
                  so that they may understand their true purpose on Earth. It
                  must include elements that are necessary to formulate worldly
                  perspectives within the Islamic paradigm, so that they can
                  find answers to the questions that arise due to the dichotomy
                  of knowledge to which they are exposed.

                <h4>Individualistic Approach vs. Mass Education</h4>
                <p>
                  The contemporary mass education system is highly influenced
                  by nationalism being imposed through the power exercised by
                  the states and is mainly the servant of capital and power. It
                  is imperative to have an individual-centric approach that can
                  produce children who are capable of discovering their true
                  talents and potentials. A well-groomed person can excel in
                  his/her field of interest and possesses the ability to polish
                  his/her innate capabilities. Collective goals are also
                  important but they need to be added in due proportion in the
                  curriculum.
